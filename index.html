                                Hi, i'm Büşra Kanbur, I'm a senior computer engineering student. 
                                I mostly work in the fields of mobile application development 
                                and UI-UX design. 
                                I've always been interested in art throughout my life. 
                                From time to time i'm also interested in music, painting, 
                                photography. Now i try to use both art and my software 
                                knowledge as much as possible while doing something.
                                <br/>Also I love black cats and poplar trees.
